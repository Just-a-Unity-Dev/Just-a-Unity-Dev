# hi i'm eclips_e (jauv, just-a-unity-dev)
nice to meet you, i'm just-a-unity-dev but I prefer to be called eclipse, i'm currently studying and (for now), and I do freelance programing. i also program in my spare time

## why do you have 2 usernames?
i've been attempting to change my GH username to eclips_e or eclips_e0001 but I've used Just-a-Unity-Dev so much in my repos that if I changed my username now, someone could possibly claim to be me and do really bad stuff
