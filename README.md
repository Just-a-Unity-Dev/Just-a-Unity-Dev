hi there feel free to call me eclipse, jaud/jauv, or rain

i'm just a guy who has too much time on his hands but doesn't use it for anything good lol

i code in many languages and i'm an amateur sysop

if you'd like to give me money, you can send eth here `6333eDDeDA49Ccc6bCfF0BB5A88f8cfb34AB83c8`

and finally yes i play games such as D&D, Lancer, Traveller, etc. i also play KSP, space engineers, and others. tl;dr: if it's set in space i will obsess over it.
